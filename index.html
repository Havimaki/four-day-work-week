      <p>It appears that Justin Trudeau, who normally goes all out for Halloween has had a change of heart. Justin
        Trudeau's Halloween costume in 2019 will apparently be no costume at all.

        According to a tweet from Sonia Aslam, a reporter for News1130, the Prime Minister's office revealed that
        Trudeau would not be dressing up this year, although they did not offer a reason as to why he made that
        decision.

        Justin Trudeau has previously shared photos of himself and his family all decked out for Halloween. He has
        previously dressed up as Clark Kent, Han Solo, and the pilot from The Little Prince.

        The decision not to wear a costume follows a scandal that broke during the election, when it was revealed that
        Trudeau had previously worn brownface and blackface on more than one occasion. Celebrities including Conan
        O'Brien and Lilly Singh made fun of the situation.

        Trudeau was even put on the spot when two young black girls asked him about it during an interview with Jessi
        Cruickshank.

        There were even discussions on Twitter about whether going as Justin Trudeau in blackface for Halloween would be
        an acceptable costume. Pumpkins sold by Bed, Bath, and Beyond which resembled blackface were also compared to
        Trudeau on Twitter.</p>
